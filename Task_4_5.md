## Procedure

I first created a branch called Temp. I then switched to Temp branch and 
then made a md file for Task_3, which i then added to Temp branch 
and then committed the changes , then pushed.<br>
Later switched back to master branch and then merged them both together 
and then commited continued by push.<br>
To the end , i created a README.md file on 4 and 5, and then pushed that 
into master branch too.
